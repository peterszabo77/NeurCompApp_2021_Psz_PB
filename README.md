Szabó P, Barthó P (2021) Decoding neurobiological spike trains using recurrent neural networks; a case study with electrophysiological auditory cortex recordings. Neural Computing and Applications (DOI: 10.1007/s00521-021-06589-0)

structure of datasets:
- comma separated values
- column names are in first row [first 500 columns are time bins, last two columns are 'sound_ID' and (learning) 'role']
- rows represent different 500ms long timeseries
- values: 0 (no action potential) or cell_ID (action potential)
